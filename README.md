## Innovation (board game)

### General plan
- backend: fastapi with websockets. In-memory datastore that will probably move to sqlite
- frontend: React. I don't know React but will learn enough for this project
- infra: not sure yet. In the beginning this will be a single container app, so _maybe_ AWS EC2 defined here with python CDK code. EC2 can be super cheap, especially if we use a small instance
